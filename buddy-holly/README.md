Load the Script<br>

This script replicates a Windows 95 Media Player with the Buddy Holly video from Weezer open.<br>
In the 90's, this was actually a reality.<br>
On the Windows 95 Installation CD there was a folder called "FUNSTUFF".<br>
In this folder, contained the music video.<br>
This is rumored to be a part of their success.<br>
It was special that they had their biggest success on their debut album.<br>
Fun fact: The album was untitled, but Geffen had to name it, so they chose "Weezer".<br>
